# Clean Your Room

## Instructions

In the initial commit to this project, you have been provided with files that contain a JavaScript module and some associated tests. Currently the `calculateProductPrice` function is working but is not very well laid out. Refactor this code so that it is much cleaner and the tests still pass.

## Provided Files

**.babelrc** - this file allows mocha to read the code files written in ES6 syntax

**.eslintrc.js** - this file tells ESLint what our style rules are for our code so we will be prompted if we violate that style

**.gitignore** - this file sets the project up to ignore the node_modules folder when committing to git

**package.json** - this file sets up the Node project including all the dev dependencies

**pricing.js** - this file contains the functions for calculating the monthly price of a product based on a users enrollment options

**tests/employee.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically an example employee

**tests/products.js** - this file contains test data used when running tests, specifically example benefits products

**tests/tests.js** - this file contains tests for the functions in the `pricing` module

## Exercise Submission

You should fork this repository and submit your working changes in a pull request to your forked repo.

## Extra Credit
The mock products file contains a commuter type product which is not currently supported. Update your functions to support providing the price of this product type as well. Employees can sign-up for either public transit or parking, not both. You should create a test for each of these scenarios.
